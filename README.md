Code for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Risk Stratification Model
This repository contains the R implementation of the hierarchical dynamic prediction model described in the paper:

“A Hierarchical Dynamic Model for Risk Stratification and Screening in Endemic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma: Secondary Analysis of NPC-PRO-001 Screening Cohort in Southern China”

Contents
The code includes:

data_trans.R – data cleaning and preparation

model_training.R – model construction and training

model_prediction.R – risk prediction and output generation

These scripts provide the main functions for data preprocessing, model training, and risk prediction based on the NPC screening cohort.

Requirements
R (version ≥ 4.0)

Common R packages such as survival, nlme, ggplot2, etc.
